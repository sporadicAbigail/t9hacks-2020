# Komputer Learn

## Inspiration
We wanted to solve the problem of under priviledged children not having the chance to learn STEM concepts because even though there are STEM schools, they are expensive.

## What it does
It makes Computer Science concepts (like what is a computer, and what is the internet) we've learned in college available online in an interactive and fun way. By introducing these concepts to our target audience at a young age, they'll be more comfortable with these concepts when they encounter them again when they're older.

## How we built it
We built our simulation using Microsoft Powerpoint, HTML, CSS, Javascript and love.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning how to code and design a front end system was a challenge for Jason. Abigail ran into a specific problem regarding javascript checking of the contents in the boxes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to create a pop up keyboard. Also, it has been a couple years since Abigail has coded with HTML, so to build a site in a short amount of time that functions is really cool.

## What we learned
Jason: front end coding
Abigail: re-learned HTML + JS

## What's next for KomputerLearn
We want to expand and create more tutorials for more concepts. We also have plans to create humanoid characters to help describe the concepts better.

## Built With
Microsoft powerpoint, JavaScript, HTML
